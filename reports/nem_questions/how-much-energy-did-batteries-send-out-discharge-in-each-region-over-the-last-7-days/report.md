        ## Data

        This report is derived from the following semantic surfaces in ClickHouse: `semantic.daily_unit_dispatch`, reconciled to one row per settlement interval and DUID, providing dispatch targets, initial MW, availability, ramp rates, and FCAS enablement. `semantic.unit_dimension`, the current reconciled DUID dimension derived from MMSDM registration history, providing region, participant, station, fuel, registered capacity, storage flags, dispatch type, and emissions factor.

        ## Note

        Results are generated from the current semantic layer in ClickHouse. If the warehouse does not yet contain full market history, the answer reflects the available window rather than authoritative all-time history.

        ## Explanation

        Top row: REGIONID=QLD1, discharge_mwh=13641.46. Returned 4 rows. The mean of `discharge_mwh` across the result set is 11588.597.
