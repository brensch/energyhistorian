        ## Data

        This report is derived from the following semantic surface in ClickHouse: `semantic.dispatch_price`, reconciled to one row per settlement interval and region, providing 5-minute energy and FCAS regional price outcomes.

        ## Note

        Results are generated from the current semantic layer in ClickHouse. If the warehouse does not yet contain full market history, the answer reflects the available window rather than authoritative all-time history.

        ## Explanation

        Top row: REGIONID=SA1, price_volatility=56.32. Returned 5 rows. The mean of `price_volatility` across the result set is 28.434.
